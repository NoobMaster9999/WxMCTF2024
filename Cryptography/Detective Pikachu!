# Detective Pickachu!

Description: Botman was playing his favourite Pokemon game when it got wiped (womp womp)! With all his hard work gone, Botman has turned to the only thing left in his game, a suspicious, seemingly useless text document. Can you help him get to the bottom of this mystery?

# Solution

We are provided with a file filled with spaces and tabs. We can use [this cipher identifier](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) and it says it is [Whitespace Language](https://www.dcode.fr/whitespace-language). Decoding it gives us:

`pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pika pipi pi pipi pi pi pi pipi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pipi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pichu pichu pichu ... `

We can put this in the cipher identifier again and it says that it is [Pikalang](https://www.dcode.fr/pikalang-language). We can now decode it to get the flag!
